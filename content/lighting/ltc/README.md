# LTC Lighting

This crate offers support for Linearly Transformed Cosine (LTC) shaders via the RRF shader API, along with tools for generating LUT textures, adapted from <https://github.com/selfshadow/ltc_code>.

run `cargo r --package rendiation-lighting-ltc --example gen --release` to generate the ltc texture in png format.

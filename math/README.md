The totally mix of some opensource math lib like cgmath aljabar;

## some innovation WIP

Normalized vec wrap type. Use type system to avoid unnecessary normalize.

Unit typed scalar and angle type. Use type system to avoid unit mis conversion.

Affine matrix type wrap. For some graphics optimization.

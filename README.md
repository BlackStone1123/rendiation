# Rendiation Renderer Framework

This repo is in very early stage.

Some direction:

* In high level abstraction, port the architecture implementation of [artgl](https://github.com/mikialex/artgl).
* In low level abstraction, wrap wgpu-rs and provide lots of convenience api such as builder patten, marcos.., as well as composable render primitives.

Use WebGPU as backend support. Support multiple native platform and web.
